== Variant senders

Variant senders work primarily with
xref:sender_adaptors.adoc#_let_value[`let_value`] to provide a runtime choice in
a computation. There are helper functions to create variant senders.

In the simplest formulation, `make_variant_sender` makes a choice between two
senders based on a boolean value (just like an `if` statement). The consequent
and alternative are lambda expressions:

[source,cpp]
----
auto s = async::make_variant_sender(/* boolean-expression */,
                                    [] { return /* a sender */; },
                                    [] { return /* a different sender */; });
----

There is also an even simpler formulation, for when the alternative sender is `just()`:

[source,cpp]
----
auto s = async::make_optional_sender(/* boolean-expression */,
                                     [] { return /* a sender */; });
----

In this case, if the boolean expression evaluates to `false`, the returned
sender will complete on the value channel as if it were `just()`.

This often suffices for a binary choice, but if we want a choice of more
possibilities, the same function supports that:

[source,cpp]
----
auto s = async::make_variant_sender(
    async::match([] (auto...) { /* test A */ }) >> [] (auto...) { return /* sender A */; },
    async::match([] (auto...) { /* test B */ }) >> [] (auto...) { return /* sender B */; },
    async::match([] (auto...) { /* test C */ }) >> [] (auto...) { return /* sender C */; },
    async::otherwise                            >> [] (auto...) { return /* fallback */; },
    args...);
----

Each predicate in turn receives the values of `args...`; the first
predicate that succeeds indicates the corresponding sender. The pattern matching
must be exhaustive; `otherwise` is a helpful catch-all to achieve that.

In the simple binary choice overload of `make_variant_sender`, the functions
take no arguments (but lambda expressions can capture what they need); in the
second more general overload, the functions take the same arguments as the
predicates do, so arguments can be used directly without capturing.

CAUTION: Capturing by reference is generally a bad idea in asynchronous code; it
is easy to get dangling references that way. Init capture by move is preferable
if needed.

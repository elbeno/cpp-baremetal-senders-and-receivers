== Pipe syntax

We can compose senders with pipe syntax, which can make things easier to read.
To take the continue_on example:

[source,cpp]
----
// this is equivalent to the previous non-piped continue_on example
auto async_computation =
    s1.schedule()
  | async::then([] { return 42; })
  | async::continue_on(s2)
  | async::then([] (int i) { return std::to_string(i); });
----

It is also possible to compose sender adaptors with pipe syntax, allowing us to
defer both where the operation runs and how the result is obtained:

[source,cpp]
----
auto async_computation =
    async::then([] { return 42; })
  | async::continue_on(s2)
  | async::then([] (int i) { return std::to_string(i); });

s1.schedule() | async_computation | async::sync_wait();
----

Custom sender adaptors (algorithms) can take advantage of this with `compose`:

[source,cpp]
----
struct custom_algo_t {
  // user-defined
};

template <sender S>
auto custom_algo(S &&s) {
  return async::compose(custom_algo_t{std::forward<S>(s)});
}
----

This means that they too can be composed with other adaptors while deferring the
entry point of the computation.
